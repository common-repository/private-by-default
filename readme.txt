When creating new posts or pages (of regular WordPress types or custom post types), this plugin makes them private by default.

== Description ==

When creating new posts or pages (of regular WordPress types or custom post types), this plugin makes them private by default.

Just activate the plugin, no further configuration is necessary (or even possible).

This plugin is a fork of the [Private Posts by Default plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/private-post-by-default/) since it didn't work properly in WordPress 4.3 and wasn't updated in more than three years.
